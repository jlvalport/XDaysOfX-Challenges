# 100DaysOfCode Round 1

## Commitment

I'm committing this round to do the [FreeCodeCamp.org Full-Stack Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) from start to finish.

## Daily logs

### Day 1: Monday June 22, 2020.

**Today's progress:** I started the first "Basic HTML and HTML5" lesson and completed 80% of it. 

**Thoughts:** I did many other things not related to code but I will dedicate more time to the course tomorrow.


### Day 2: Tuesday June 23, 2020.

**Today's progress:** I got to finish the lesson I left uncompleted yesterday and completed half of the "Basic CSS" lesson.

**Thoughts:** I need to go faster if I want to complete the whole course within the 100 days.


### Day 3: Wednesday June 24, 2020.

**Today's progress:** I finished the previous lesson and completed 80% of the "Applied Visual Design" lesson - which is the largest in this module - and learned lots of new things and discovered how to apply things I already knew in different ways. I realized that adding two shadows makes the div look a lot better, one shadow more blurred than the other. I learned how to use CSS variables. I learned about the :root pseudo class and it's high specificity. I knew about linear-gradient, but didn't know about repeat-linear-gradient. I liked the way the hsl() color selection option can use the same color you are using elsewhere and only change its saturation and lighting. learned what the skew transform option is used for... I had seen its uses before but didn't know how to create those styles. I learned how to make a heart icon in pure CSS: awesome!

**Thoughts:** FreeCodeCamp's course is teaching me things I'd missed before. I want to keep learning more each day that passes. 


### Day 4: Thursday June 25, 2020.

**Today's progress:** I completed the lesson from yesterday and two more: the "Applied Accessibility" lesson and the "Responsive Web Design Principles" lesson. Today I learned how to set CSS animations to stop at the end and not reset with animation-fill-mode; One could also use the transition CSS rule. I understand now how the timing functions work: ease, ease-in, ease-out and finally got to review how the cubic-bezier point system works. [This online tool](https://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67) is great to see that in action. I learned about the time tag and how helpful it is for assistive technologies. I will use colorblindness tools and contrast ratio tools to build websites that help visually impaired people understand better its contents. Writing click me or see more as links isn't helpful to people who use screen readers and jump right to the links to find out what's in the web site. One needs to be descriptive when creating links. An easy way to add shortcuts to the webpage is to use the accesskey attribute. I also learned what's the maximum height and width of an image should not be more than half of its original size so that it doesn't get pixilated in high resolution screens.

**Thoughts:** People with disabilities need to be supported and one should always create websites with accessability in mind. 


### Day 5: Friday June 26, 2020.

**Today's progress:** I'm halfway through the "Flexbox" lesson.

**Thoughts:** CSS really needed this so developers could start creating better looking websites.
