# 100DaysOfCode Round 1

## Commitment

I'm committing this round to do the [FreeCodeCamp.org Full-Stack Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) from start to finish.

## Daily logs

### Day 1: Monday June 22, 2020.

**Today's progress:** I started the first "Basic HTML and HTML5" lesson and completed 80% of it. 

**Thoughts:** I did many other things not related to code but I will dedicate more time to the course tomorrow.


### Day 2: Tuesday June 23, 2020.

**Today's progress:** I got to finish the lesson I left uncompleted yesterday and completed half of the "Basic CSS" lesson.

**Thoughts:** I need to go faster if I want to complete the whole course within the 100 days.

### Day 3: Wednesday June 24, 2020.

**Today's progress:** I finished the previous lesson and completed 80% of the "Applied Visual Design" lesson - which is the largest in this module - and learned lots of new things and discovered how to apply things I already knew in different ways. I realized that adding two shadows makes the div look a lot better, one shadow more blurred than the other. I learned how to use CSS variables. I learned about the :root pseudo class and it's high specificity. I knew about linear-gradient, but didn't know about repeat-linear-gradient. I liked the way the hsl() color selection option can use the same color you are using elsewhere and only change its saturation and lighting. learned what the skew transform option is used for... I had seen its uses before but didn't know how to create those styles. I learned how to make a heart icon in pure CSS: awesome!

**Thoughts:** FreeCodeCamp's course is teaching me things I'd missed before. I want to keep learning more each day that passes.
